# Programmer Drills

> [!Important]
> This datapack has been designed exclusively for minecraft `1.21.11`!  
> It will probably work on higher versions, but I make no promises 🙃

A datapack which adds various programmer art styled drills to survival!  
Each drill will automatically dig straight down once powered on (right-clicked) until it reaches a block it cannot break, is broken by a player (left-click), or is broken by the environment (iron drills break in water!).  
To place a drill, simply throw it on the ground!  
Recipes can be found in the recipe book.

Tier | Speed | Hole Size
--- | --- | ---
Iron | 2 blocks per minute | 1x1
Diamond | 2 blocks per minute | 1x1
Netherite | 2 blocks per minute | 1x1
Power | 2 blocks per minute | 3x3

I'm unsure how balanced (or unbalanced) these actually are in game (hence the rather pricey recipes); please send me any feedback via issues!

Each pillar as its respective drill both in an item frame on the center block, and physically in the world directly in front of it.](./.web/screenshot.png)
